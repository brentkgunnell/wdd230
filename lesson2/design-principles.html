        <p>
          I feel that this site does a good job with White Space. As was
          described in one of our readings this week, on this page there is
          "breathing room." Nothing is squished together which makes it easier
          to find what you're looking for on the site.

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <h3>Komo 4 News, Seattle, WA</h3>
        <a href="https://komonews.com" target="_blank">Komo News Site</a>
        <img src="images/rsz_1rsz_komonewscom_.png" />
        <p>I believe this site is a good example of horizontal alignment.  The article descriptions
          and pictures are lined up very well which does a good job of leading your eye from one article 
          to the next.  The max-width is also used well for larger screens.

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <h3>Seattle Seahawks</h3>
        <a href="https://www.seahawks.com/schedule/" target="_blank"
          >Seahawks Schedule Site</a
        >
        <img src="images/rsz_rsz_wwwseahawkscom_schedule_.png" />
        <p>
          The principle of contrast is illustrated very well by the use of color
          on this site. In particular the use of the neon green color for the
          "Buy Tickets" button. Obviously, they want consumers to make a
          purchase and the neon green instantly grabs your attention when you
          first get on the site.
